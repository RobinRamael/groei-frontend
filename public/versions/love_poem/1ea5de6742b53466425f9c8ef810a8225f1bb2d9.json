{"content": "tonight  \nI contemplate having the rowdy ambulances,  \nlooking for fodder on the outskirts of town,  \nstop here, for a change, right in my fucking living room,  \nwhere I theatrically implode under the coffee table  \nwaiting for the everything inevitable,  \nthe imminent death of whatever we've done.  \n  \n  \n  \n  \ni write sometimes, but mostly it comes out  \nas modernist screams, i carry a notebook, i do what i can.  \ni swear what follows is an honest question  \nif not a prophet, who the hell do i think i am  \nto crawl into your arms like this  \nand yet remain stuck in the difference,  \nthe dividable lines between infinite objects,  \nthe fact of the matter a network of lies.  \n  \nit would be wrong of me to say  \nthat you don't figure in it, but i have forgotten  \nin what way, and you keep silent, mesmerized  \nor bored, most likely respectfully annoyed  \n  \nthere is this story i misheard from the soviet union  \nabout a poet being arrested after a party  \ntheir body being dragged in a car  \nshouting to their friends, wailing on the curb  \n'no! do you not understand the beauty  \nof being arrested for writing about love?'  \n  \nand i wonder what will happen when finally i am arrested  \nwill i scream and struggle to, in one line  \ngive meaning to someone else's survival  \nor will i go into my own mind  \nand sit there  \nand sing?  \n\n", "created": "2019-02-04T00:02:15+00:00"}
