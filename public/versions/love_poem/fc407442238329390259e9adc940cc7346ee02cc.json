{"content": "tonight  \nI contemplate having the rowdy ambulances,  \nlooking for fodder on the outskirts of town,  \nstop here, for a change, right in my fucking living room,  \nwhere I theatrically implode under the coffee table  \nwaiting for the everything inevitable,  \nthe imminent death of whatever we've done.  \n  \n  \n  \nwho am i, to crawl into your arms like this?  \nto lay the issue out in hermeneutical crying  \n  \ni write, sometimes, but mostly it comes out  \nas modernist screams.  \ni carry a notebook, i do what i can  \nand yet remain stuck in the difference,  \nthe dividable lines between infinite objects,  \nto distill something pretty out of a network of lies.  \n  \nit would be wrong of me to say  \nthat you don't figure in it, but i have forgotten  \nin what way, and you have kept silent, mesmerized  \nor bored, most likely annoyed at what  \nhas crawled into your arms like this  \nand cried in secrets,  \n  \nthere is this story i misheard from the soviet union  \nabout a poet being arrested after a party  \ntheir body being dragged in a car  \nshouting to their friends, wailing on the curb  \n'no! do you not understand the beauty  \nof being arrested for writing about love?'  \n  \nand i wonder what will happen when finally i am arrested  \nwill i scream and struggle to, in one line  \ngive meaning to someone else's survival  \nor will i go into my own mind  \nand sit there  \nand sing?  \n\n", "created": "2019-01-25T20:24:59+00:00"}
