{"content": "tonight  \nI contemplate having the rowdy ambulances,  \nlooking for fodder on the outskirts of town,  \nstop here, for a change, right in my fucking living room,  \nwhere I implode under the coffee table  \nwaiting for the everything inevitable,  \nthe imminent death of whatever we've done.  \n  \n  \nwho am i, to crawl into your arms like this?  \n  \ni write, sometimes, but mostly it comes out  \nas modernist screams. i carry a notebook,  \ni do what i can. talking helps, i guess,  \nbut does it register? does it even work?  \n  \n  \n  \ni am reminded of a story i misheard from the soviet union  \nabout a poet being arrested after a party  \ntheir body being dragged in a car  \nshouting to their friends, wailing on the curb  \n'no! do you not understand the beauty  \nof being arrested for writing about love?'  \n  \nand i wonder what will happen when finally i am arrested  \nwill i scream, and struggle to, in one line  \ngive meaning to someone else's survival  \nor will i go into my own mind  \nand sit there  \nand sing.  \n\n", "created": "2018-11-22T12:30:18+00:00"}
