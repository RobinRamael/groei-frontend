{"content": "**love poem**  \n  \ni write sometimes, but mostly it comes out  \nas modernist screams, i carry a notebook, i do what i can.  \nlately, i have been erasing the words  \nout of diagrams and looking at what 's left;  \ndespite the government's assertions  \ni have not encountered meaning.  \nit would be wrong of me to say  \nthat you don't figure in it, but you keep silent, bored  \nor mesmerized, what does it matter.  \n  \ni swear what follows is an honest question;  \nif not a prophet, who the hell do i think i am  \nto crawl into your arms like this  \nand remain stuck in the difference,  \nthe dividable lines between infinite objects,  \nthe fact of the matter as a network of lies.  \n  \nthere is this story i misheard from the soviet union  \nabout a poet being arrested after a party,  \ntheir body being dragged in a car  \nshouting to their friends, wailing on the curb  \n'no! do you not understand the beauty  \nof being arrested for writing about love?'  \n  \nand i wonder what will happen when finally i am arrested  \nwill i scream and struggle to, in one line,  \ngive meaning to someone else's survival  \nor will i go into my own mind  \nand sit there  \nand sing?  \n\n", "created": "2019-05-10T12:50:07+00:00"}
