{"content": "tonight  \nI contemplate having the rowdy ambulances,  \nlooking for fodder on the outskirts of town,  \nstop here, for a change, right in my living room,  \nright here where I (ever the drama queen)  \nhave crawled under the coffee table  \nwaiting for the everything inevitable,  \nthe imminent death of whatever we've done.  \n  \n  \nwho am i to crawl into your arms like this  \nto use my rickety platform of verse  \n  \ni write, sometimes, but mostly it comes out  \nas modernist screams. i carry a notebook,  \ni do what i can. talking helps,  \nbut what does it do for you?  \n  \ni am reminded of a story i misheard from the soviet union  \nabout a poet being arrested after a party  \ntheir body being dragged in a car  \nshouting to their friends, wailing on the curb  \n'no! do you not understand the beauty  \nof being arrested for writing about love?'  \n  \nand i wonder what will happen when finally i am arrested  \nwill i scream, and struggle to, in one line  \ngive meaning to someone else's survival  \nor will i go into my own mind  \nand sit there  \nand sing.  \n\n", "created": "2018-11-19T10:46:52+00:00"}
