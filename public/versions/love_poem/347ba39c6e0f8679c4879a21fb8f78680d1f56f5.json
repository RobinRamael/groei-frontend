{"content": "tonight  \nI contemplate having the rowdy ambulances,  \nlooking for fodder on the outskirts of town,  \nstop here, for a change, right in my living room,  \nright where I (ever the drama queen)  \nhave crawled under the coffee table  \nwaiting for the everything inevitable,  \nthe imminent death of whatever we've done.  \n  \nsomeone once called my poetry hopeful  \nand I have no idea if it is. mostly I wonder,  \nwho do I think I am, to crawl into your arms like this  \nand cry in free verse  \n  \ni write, sometimes, but mostly it comes out  \nas modernist screams. i carry a notebook,  \ni do what i can. talking helps, i guess,  \nbut does it help you?  \n  \ni am reminded of a story i misheard from the soviet union  \nabout a poet being arrested after a party  \ntheir body being dragged in a car  \nshouting to their friends, wailing on the curb  \n'no! do you not understand the beauty  \nof being arrested for writing about love?'  \n  \nand i wonder what will happen when finally i am arrested  \nwill i scream, and struggle to, in one line  \ngive meaning to someone else's survival  \nor will i go into my own mind  \nand sit there  \nand sing.  \n\n", "created": "2018-11-19T10:55:15+00:00"}
